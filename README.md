# How to install
- install IDE (InteliJ)
- install JDK

# knowns issues:

when you get this error: `java.lang.IllegalStateException: The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver` that means you need to dowload chromedriver to your root folder.
You can download it from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.33/
